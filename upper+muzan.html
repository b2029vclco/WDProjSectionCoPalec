            <img src="all_images\Muzan.png" alt="Right Image" class="side-image">
            <p><b>Muzan Kibutsuji</b> is the king of all demons and the source of suffering, for humans and demons alike. His presence alone suffocates the air, filling even demons with terror. He wears many faces, shifting forms as easily as one changes clothes, but his eyes always carry cold cruelty. Muzan tolerates no weakness and disposes of his followers without hesitation. He grants power only to tighten his control, never out of mercy. His intelligence is sharp, calculating every move centuries in advance. He despises imperfection and views humans as nothing more than objects. To him, even the Upper Moons exist only to serve his survival. Muzan fears death above all else, though he keeps that to himself. Every demon knows that failing him is worse than dying by a blade.</p>

    <h2>「  Upper Moon 1 」</h2>    
        <div class="left-content">
            <p>Upper Moon One, named <b>Kokushibo</b>, is the most terrifying warrior amongst the Upper Moons. His six eyes see through every movement, every breath, every weakness. He speaks little, but his words carry the weight of centuries. Kokushibo values strength above all else and despises those who falter. His blade and his Moon Breathing feel endless, overwhelming even the strongest swordsmen. He carries himself with rigid discipline and cold honor. There is sorrow buried deep within him, though it has long since hardened into obsession. Kokushibo seeks perfection in the sword, no matter the cost. Even other demons feel small standing before him. He is living proof that power gained through regret never truly satisfies.</p>

            <img src="all_images\UPM2.png" alt="Right Image" class="side-image">
            <p><b>Douma</b>, known as Upper Moon Two, wears a constant smile that hides his lack of emotion. He speaks kindly, warmly, as if he truly loves everyone he meets. Yet behind that pleasant tone lies complete emptiness. Douma feels no sorrow, no guilt, and no empathy, even as he kills. He treats humans and demons alike as fascinating toys. His ice techniques are beautiful and deadly, freezing bodies and hope alike. He owns a cult, and his followers worship him as a god, unaware he feels nothing for them. Douma mocks suffering simply by existing so cheerfully. His lack of emotion makes him deeply unsettling. </p>

    <h2>「  Upper Moon 3 」</h2>
        <div class="left-content">
            <p>Upper Moon Three, <b>Akaza</b>, is driven by strength and the pursuit of battle. He respects powerful fighters and despises the weak without hesitation. His fists strike like thunder, shattering bones before blades can even touch him. Akaza refuses to kill women, guided by morals even he barely understands, until later on. Rage fuels him, but sorrow hides beneath every blow from his fists. He challenges opponents not for cruelty, but for meaning. Akaza loathes himself more than anyone else ever could. His combat spirit is relentless, never backing down no matter the odds. However, memories he cannot fully grasp haunt his existence.</p>

            <img src="all_images\UPM4.png" alt="Right Image" class="side-image">
            <p><b>Hantengu</b>, the Upper Moon Four, is pitiful, cowardly, and endlessly afraid. He cowers and cries, blaming others for every evil he commits. Yet from that weakness emerge terrifying incarnations of emotion. His fear gives birth to four new personas–representing rage, sorrow, joy, and hatred. Each form embodies the feelings he refuses to accept. Hantengu claims innocence even as countless die by his hands. His true body is small and desperate, always trying to escape blame. He clings to victimhood like a shield, and the more cornered he becomes, the more monstrous his powers grow. Hantengu is the embodiment of cowardice refusing responsibility.</p>

    <h2>「  Upper Moon 5 」</h2>
        <div class="left-content">
            <p><b>Gyokko</b>, known as Upper Moon Five, is obsessed with what he calls art, no matter how grotesque it appears. He treats death as a canvas and suffering as decoration. His body twists unnaturally, emerging from pots like some warped sculpture. Gyokko takes pride in shocking reactions, thriving on disgust and fear. He believes beauty lies in distortion and decay. His voice drips with arrogance and self-praise. Gyokko cannot tolerate criticism, reacting violently to insults. He sees humans as materials rather than live, and even among demons, his mind feels disturbingly alien, especially due to his unsightly appearance.</p>

            <img src="all_images\UPM6.png" alt="Right Image" class="side-image">
            <p>There are two Upper Moon Six demons, <b>Daki and Gyutaro</b>. They are siblings bound by blood, hatred, and survival. Daki is cruel, vain, and obsessed with beauty and status. She delights in tormenting humans who she believes look down on her. Gyutaro lurks behind her, resentful and sharp-tongued. He despises the world that rejected them from birth. Though they fight differently, their bond is inseparable. Gyutaro protects Daki fiercely, even at the cost of himself. Daki relies on his strength more than she will ever admit, and together, their resentment feeds their power.</p>

            <img src="all_images\Nezuko.png" alt="Right Image" class="side-image">
            <p>Nezuko Kamado is the younger sister of Tanjiro Kamado. She was once an ordinary, gentle girl who loved her family deeply. Everything she was shattered on the night Muzan took her home and her loved ones. Even after becoming a demon, she clung to the warmth of her human heart and protects humans instinctively, as if remembering who she used to be. Nezuko endures her hunger in silence, choosing sleep over blood. Her bond with Tanjiro anchors her, keeping her from losing herself. Although she rarely speaks, her emotions are clear through her actions. Strength awakens in her when those she loves are threatened–the kindness she once showed as a human still guides her choices. Nezuko is proof that humanity can survive even in a demon’s body.</p>
