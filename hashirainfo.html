            <p><b>Gyomei Himejima</b> is the current Stone Pillar of the Demon Slayer Corps. He is a tall, muscular man with a rather intimidating aura, however, he is a kind and gentle soul at heart. He is quite disciplined and religious, often seen holding his prayer beads. Gyomei is blind, but he is not to be underestimated during battle. The other pillars and members of the Corps acknowledge him to be an incredibly strong warrior–one of, if not the strongest of his generation. He wields a unique weapon, a flail and axe, which he uses alongside Stone Breathing.</p>

        <div class="left-content">
            <p><b>Sanemi Shinazugawa</b> is the current Wind Pillar of the Demon Slayer Corps. He is known for his aggressive and volatile nature, being hot-tempered, blunt, and often cruel with his words, especially toward those he believes are weak. He has spiky white hair, sharp eyes, and a body covered in scars from countless battles with demons. Despite this harsh exterior, he deeply cares for others. He harbors an intense hatred for demons due to the trauma of his past. Sanemi’s fighting style is wild and relentless, matching his Wind Breathing techniques. Beneath his rage, he is a deeply wounded and loyal man who bears his pain in silence.</p>

He has long, dark hair, sharp blue eyes, and  wears a half-and-half haori that once belonged to his late friends. Giyu is quiet, stoic, and socially awkward, often coming across as cold or distant to others. In reality, he is deeply kind and compassionate, though he struggles with guilt and feelings of unworthiness. Giyu, despite his self-doubts, is much more skilled than he thinks–having mastered Water Breathing and even creating his own technique. He was the one who spared Tanjiro and Nezuko, and alongside his master, Urokodaki–vowed to commit <i>seppuku</i> if Nezuko ever ate a human.</p>

He has long black hair that fades into teal, along with distant, unfocused eyes that often seem lost in thought. Muichiro is usually apathetic, blank, and forgetful, appearing detached from his surroundings. This behavior is due to his amnesia and emotional trauma from his past after losing his twin brother. In battle, he becomes sharp, ruthless, and incredibly skilled. Despite his aloof nature, Muichiro possesses a kind heart and strong sense of justice. At his core, Muichiro is a childish and cheerful soul.</p>
