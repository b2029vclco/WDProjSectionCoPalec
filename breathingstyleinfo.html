            <p>The Sun Breathing technique is the very first breathing technique invented by the very first demon slayer, Yoriichi Tsugikuni. This technique is the strongest breathing style of all, as other breathing styles are derived from this sty\le. It replicate the movements of the sun, being incredibly versatile and unpredictable. In Tanjiro's family, this breathing technique was passed down in the form of a dance, called <i>Hinokami Kagura.</i></p>
