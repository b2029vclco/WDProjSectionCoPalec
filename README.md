### Description
### Our website aims to serve as a guide for fellow demon slayers on how to identify and master their breathing techniques, know their friends and hashiras, and learn about potential encounters with deadly demons, especially with the king of demons, Muzan Kibutsuji. 

### It will tell you how to survive and enter the Demon Slayer Corps, as well as certain items you get when you get in, like your katana, the nichirin blade, or your crow, who will give you tasks, and how to properly analyze demon fighting styles. It teaches you how to learn from your peers and leaders, and who leads the Demon Slayer Corps, Master Ubuyashiki.

### Webpage Breakdown:
### P1 (Home Page): The home page introduces the user to the other web pages, and acts as an introduction to explain to the user how this web page is a guide for Demon Slayers.
### P2 (Hashira and Protagonists Info): This page will discuss the samurais, protagonists, and good characters in Demon Slayer. It will discuss their power levels, breathing styles, traits, attitudes, and rankings in the Demon Slayer hierarchy.
### P3 (Which breathing styles are you?): This is a quiz for fans and demon slayers to determine which breathing style they will use. This is a heavy choice, as the breathing style you choose is permanent, and could affect how you fight demons. We believe this is the only page we will use javascript on, because we will use javascript(if statements) to figure out the user's breathing style through the quiz. 
### P4 (Breathing Styles Info): This page will show the different types of breathing styles, and whether they focus on speed, strength, defense, or more. It also contains what the swords, or nichirin blades, are made of, and it discusses other things that a demon slayer uses, like the wisteria herb, and the messenger and intel crows.
### P5 (Upper Moons and Muzan Info):  "If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles". To know how to slay demons, we should learn about them. This page contains info about the 7 strongest demons, which are the 6 upper moons, and their king, Muzan Kibutsuji. To prepare to battle, we must study them.
